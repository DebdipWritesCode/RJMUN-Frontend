**Dear Delegates, Executive Board Members, and Honoured Guests,**

It is my absolute pleasure to welcome you to **RJMUN 2.0** — a space where ideas meet action, perspectives collide respectfully, and diplomacy takes center stage.

Whether you're stepping into a committee room for the first time or returning as a seasoned delegate, I want you to know — *you belong here*. RJMUN has always stood for inclusivity, intellect, and intensity (with a sprinkle of humour and a lot of caffeine behind the scenes).

This conference is more than an academic simulation. It's a shared experience. A platform to voice bold opinions, craft clever resolutions, and maybe even make a few friends who argue as passionately as you do.

Behind this event is a team that’s poured its heart into creating something memorable — from curating thoughtful agendas to ensuring the Wi-Fi doesn’t crash mid-speech (fingers crossed). We’ve tried our best to make **RJMUN 2.0** not just a conference, but a community.

So walk in with confidence, curiosity, and an open mind. Debate with respect, speak with purpose, and don’t forget to enjoy the chaos along the way.

And remember — diplomacy is serious business… but that doesn’t mean you can’t have a little fun while doing it.

Looking forward to seeing all of you in action.

**With warmest regards,**  
**Bhargav Bidkar**  
Secretary-General  
**RJMUN 2.0**
