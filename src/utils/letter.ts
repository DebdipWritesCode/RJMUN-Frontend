**Dear Delegates, Executive Board Members, and Honoured Guests,**

It is my absolute pleasure to welcome you to **RJMUN 2.0** — a space where ideas meet action, perspectives collide respectfully, and diplomacy takes center stage.

Whether you're stepping into a committee room for the first time or returning as a seasoned delegate, I want you to know — *you belong here*. RJMUN has always stood for inclusivity, intellect, and intensity (with a sprinkle of humour and a lot of caffeine behind the scenes).

This conference is more than an academic simulation. It's a shared experience. A platform to voice bold opinions, craft clever resolutions, and maybe even make a few friends who argue as passionately as you do.

Behind this event is a team that’s poured its heart into creating something memorable — from curating thoughtful agendas to ensuring the Wi-Fi doesn’t crash mid-speech (fingers crossed). We’ve tried our best to make **RJMUN 2.0** not just a conference, but a community.

So walk in with confidence, curiosity, and an open mind. Debate with respect, speak with purpose, and don’t forget to enjoy the chaos along the way.

And remember — diplomacy is serious business… but that doesn’t mean you can’t have a little fun while doing it.

Looking forward to seeing all of you in action.

**With warmest regards,**  
**Bhargav Bidkar**  
Secretary-General  
**RJMUN 2.0**

**Dear Delegates, Faculty Members, and Esteemed Guests,**

It is with great pride and joy that I extend a warm welcome to each one of you to RJMUN 2.0, hosted by RJ International School.

Model United Nations conferences are more than just academic simulations—they are platforms where students cultivate the values of diplomacy, leadership, collaboration, and critical thinking. They offer a space for young minds to engage with pressing global issues, develop their public speaking and negotiation skills, and most importantly, learn the importance of respectful dialogue in a diverse world.

At RJ International School, we are committed to nurturing students who are not only academically sound but also socially conscious and globally aware. Events like RJMUN align perfectly with this vision, as they empower participants to voice their thoughts, challenge ideas, and work towards collective solutions in a spirit of mutual respect.

I commend the Secretariat, the Organising Team, and all those who have worked diligently behind the scenes to bring this event to life. Your dedication, passion, and professionalism reflect the highest standards of our institution.

To all delegates: I encourage you to participate wholeheartedly, debate constructively, and make the most of this enriching experience. I am confident that RJMUN 2.0 will be a memorable and impactful chapter in your academic and personal journeys.

Wishing you all a successful and inspiring conference.

**With warmest regards,**  
**Mrs. Shilpa Pathak**  
Principal  
**RJ International School**
