At RJ International School, we believe that education goes beyond textbooks—it’s about nurturing leadership, critical thinking, and global citizenship.With opportunity in our hand we successfully launched our first RJ MUN in April 2025 with hope to create new opportunities for the delegates and enhance their experience.
       
From April 18-20,2025 ,RJ International School proudly hosted a dynamic MUN conference that brought together passionate delegates, challenging agendas, and a shared vision for a better world . RJMUN was more than just an academic event , it was a celebration of student voice , curiosity and ambition.With RJMUN, RJ International School set in motion a tradition of excellence, global awareness, and transformative learning — one that will continue to inspire generations of young changemakers in the years to come.
